Here we are create terraform VPC modules,along with inputs & outpputs keep configuration in variables.make sure use tags, naming convension then test mosules in dev environment once its created successfuly push into github.

This module creates following resources. We are using HA, we are getting first 2 AZ automatically.

Private Route Table
Database Route Table
Subnets and Route table associations
